{Kevin and I go way back. I checked the USCF player stats and my previous record against Kevin was 4 losses and 1 draw out of 5 games. All of our previous games were between 1992-1998.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. g3 {Avrukh says to play 3.g3 instead of 3.Nf3 in case the Knight later comes to e2, as in the Bogo-Indian.} d5 4. Bg2 c6 5. Nf3 Be7 6. O-O Nbd7 1-0
